A lot of my projects are motivated by seeing something, and imagining coding it to be pretty fun.
Wordle piqued my interest as a project that was small in scope, interesting, and simple enough that it was easy to break it down into small tasks.

I ended up going down a rabbit hole with my little twist on it; you have the ability to share your own wordle puzzle, which is encoded in the URL.
The encoding is nothing secure, but it was fun to create. I went down a rabbit hole in the rabbit hole trying to implement a sort of promise-like builder for the encoding steps.
